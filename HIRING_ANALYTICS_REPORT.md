### Original Data (May 20 - Nov 13, 2025)
```
930 Applications (100%)
  ├── 698 in Inbox stage (75.1%)

```

### Original Conversion Rate: 0.32%

### Stage-by-Stage Breakdown
| Stage | Total Candidates | Hired | Rejected | Active | Rejection Rate |
|-------|------------------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Inbox | 698 | 0 | 351 | 347 | 50.3% |

- **78.9% rejection at Screening** - Very strict first filter
- **82.3% rejection at People Interview** - Cultural fit issues
- **80% rejection at Code Interview** - Technical bar very high

---

## 5. Location/Country Ratio

⚠️ **CRITICAL DATA QUALITY ISSUE**

**All 930 applications show "Unknown" location.**

This prevents analysis of:
- Geographic conversion rates
- Location-based hiring patterns
- Remote vs on-site effectiveness
- Regional candidate quality

**Recommendation:** Update data collection process to capture candidate location.

---

## 6. Average Time to Hire

### Overall Metrics
- **Average Time to Hire:** 39.0 days
- **Median Time to Hire:** 39.0 days
- **Minimum:** 35 days
- **Maximum:** 43 days

### By Job Position
| Job Title | Avg. Time to Hire | # of Hires |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Mid N³R Full Stack Dev | 43 days | 1 |
| Recruiting and People Support | 35 days | 1 |
| Sr .NET Full Stack Dev | 39 days | 1 |

### Insights:
- **Consistent hiring timeline** (35-43 days) across all positions
- **Non-technical role** (Recruiting) was fastest at 35 days
- **Limited data** - only 3 hires make trends unreliable

---

## 7. Average Time Per Stage

⚠️ **Data Limitation:** Cannot calculate average time per stage because:
- Sourcing/stage transition dates not consistently captured
- Only "Created at" and "Rejected at" dates available
- No timestamps for stage progressions

**Available Data:**
- Time from application to rejection (where applicable)
- Time to hire (only for 3 successful hires: 35, 39, 43 days)

**Recommendation:** Implement stage timestamp tracking in ATS.

---

## 8. Hiring Team Members

⚠️ **Data Not Available**

The current dataset does not include:
- Interviewer names
- Hiring manager assignments
- Recruiting team assignments
- Interview panel composition

**Recommendation:** Export additional report from ATS with:
- Interviewer assignments per candidate
- Hiring manager per position
- Recruiter assignments
- Interview feedback contributors

---

## 9. Boosts Analysis

⚠️ **Data Not Available**

The term "boosts" typically refers to:
- Expedited processing
- Premium sourcing campaigns
- Fast-track candidates
- Special referrals

**Current dataset does not contain:**
- Boost flags or indicators
- Source campaign details
- Priority markers
- Referral information

**What we DO know from "Referring site" field:**
- 100% of applications show "Unknown" source
- No tracking of LinkedIn, job boards, referrals, etc.

**Recommendation:**
1. Implement source tracking in ATS
2. Add boost/priority flags to candidate records
3. Track campaign IDs for sourcing initiatives

---
